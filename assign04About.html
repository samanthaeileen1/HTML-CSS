 <!--PARAGRAPH-->
 <p style="text-align:left">My life experiences lead me to believe that everyone is born creative in some way, shape of form. Everyone has an inner artist. For example, when people find out I'm an artist, a painter in particular, they continue the conversation with, "You ought to paint..." then they describe an image they have in their mind. It happens All. The. Time. I often wonder why they don't create their image. When I ask them why they don't paint (or draw, sculpt, write, or form) that ideas they are ready with the answer that school/society has brainwashed them with...
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">"I'm not creative!"</span>
<br>
How many times have you heard that? Or said that? Over time we either embrace or abandon that thought. I've done both. 
<br>
In my mind, creativity and art are not the same. Creativity is the power to create, to bring something to life. The something made, the end result, is the art. The art is where we get caught up comparing our images to others and that stops us.  When we enjoy the process of making we come to life. We remember something innate in ourself - that we were born creative.

  No one ever really lives until they venture to be creative.
